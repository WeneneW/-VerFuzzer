## Our Work
In modern electronic system design, the **logic synthesis and functional simulation steps of Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) play a crucial role**. 
These steps are performed by **Electronic Design Automation tools**, which **convert Hardware Description Language (HDL) code into logic gates and circuit layouts**, and **simulate their behavior to ensure the correctness and stability of the design**. 
However, **logic synthesis tools and simulation tools may contain defects** that can cause the design to exhibit unexpected behavior when being implemented in hardware, leading to serious consequences. 
Although existing FPGA fuzzers face limitations such as **limited complexity and diversity of test cases, fixed and single input signals**, as well as **inadequate consideration of clock variations**, which restrict their effectiveness in thoroughly testing logic synthesis tools.
To address these limitations, we propose a novel fuzzing method named **VerFuzzer**, the **first fuzz testing tool that leverages the prompting large language models for generating valid Verilog programs** to test logic synthesis tools.
By leveraging prompt learning, VerFuzzer **generates Verilog programs that accommodate both syntax evolution and diversification**, thereby resolving the aforementioned challenges. 
Furthermore, its **generation pattern, based on syntax tree branching structures**, facilitates **bug identification and test case reduction** by comparing HDL designs before and after expansion. 
Through **differential testing**, VerFuzzer effectively **reveals potential defects in logic synthesis and simulation tools**.
